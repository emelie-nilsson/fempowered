    <p>Fempowered was born from experience — and frustration.</p>
    <p>As women with strong, athletic bodies, we struggled to find activewear that truly fit.
    Leggings would roll, seams would dig, and “oversized” meant baggy in all the wrong places. 
    Most brands asked us to choose: comfort or style, performance or femininity, muscle or softness.</p>

    <p>So we stopped choosing — and started creating.</p>

    <p>Fempowered exists to fill the gap we couldn’t ignore:
    Activewear that celebrates curves, strength, and athleticism — without compromising on fit, function, or identity.</p>

    <p><strong>Our mission is simple:</strong><br>
    To empower women who train hard and show up — in bodies that don’t follow the standard template.</p>

    <p>We’re not here to fit into outdated ideals.<br>
    We’re here to redefine them.</p>

    <p><strong>Your body was never the issue.</strong><br>
    The industry just wasn’t built for it — until now.</p>
